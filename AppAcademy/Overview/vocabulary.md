# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**TDD is a process for writing software. Basic steps:**

1. Add a test.
2. Run all the tests and make sure the new test fails
3. Write code.
4. Run all the tests and make sure the new test passes.
5. Refactor the code.


# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD is an extension of TDD. Itstructures the testing process through the use of user stories - a description of the user's use of the feature being developed. The goal of the user story is to help focus the developer on what to test and what not to test.



# Unit Test

Unit testing is a way of testing an application by breaking the application down into its smallest constituent parts and testing each part iin isolation. In order to test parts of an application that rely on other code, unit tests typically use mock objects to make sure that problems elsewhere in the code won't cause the tests to mistakenly fail.

UNit testing is often automated at larger or more sophisticated companies.


# Integration Test

Integration testing is a form of testing in which units of code are combined ("integrated") and the results of theur interactions are tested. This type of testing is done after each of the individual units has been tested.


# Test Coverage

"Test Coverage" refers to how much of a software program has been tested. This can refer to several things, including thr percentage of statements in the code that have been executed by the test suite.
