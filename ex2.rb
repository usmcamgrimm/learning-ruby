# Exercise 2 - Comments and Pound Characters
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later
# Anything after the # (octothorpe) is ignored by ruby

puts "I could have code like this." # and this comment is ignored

#You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."
